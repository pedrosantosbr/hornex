            grant to Hornex.gg, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and
            partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully
            sublicenseable license to use, distribute, edit, display, archive,

            form, media, software, or technology of any kind now known or
            developed in the future, including, without limitation, for
            developing, manufacturing, and marketing products. You hereby waive
            any moral rights you may have in your User Submissions.
          </TermsText>
          <TermsText>
            In addition, you agree that any User Submissions you submit shall
            not contain any material that is, in the sole and absolute
            discretion of Hornex.gg, inappropriate, obscene, vulgar, unlawful,
            or otherwise objectionable (hereinafter, “Prohibited Content”).
            Posting of any Prohibited Content, in addition to any and all other
            rights and remedies available to Hornex.gg, may result in account
            suspension or termination.

          <TermsText>
            We respect your ownership of User Submissions. If you owned a User
            Submission before providing it to us, you will continue owning it
            after providing it to us, subject to any rights granted in the Terms
            of Use and any access granted to others. If you delete a User
            Submission from the Services, our general license to that User
            Submission will end after a reasonable period of time required for
            the deletion to take full effect. However, the User Submission may
            still exist in our backup copies, which are not publicly available.
            If your User Submission is shared with third parties, those third
            parties may have retained copies of your User Submissions. In
            addition, if we made use of your User Submission before you deleted
            it, we will continue to have the right to make, duplicate,
            redistribute, and sublicense those pre-existing uses, even after you
            delete the User Submission. Terminating your account on a Service
            will not automatically delete your User Submissions.

          <TermsText>
            We may refuse or remove a User Submission without notice to you.
            However, we have no obligation to monitor User Submissions, and you
            agree that neither we nor our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates,
            employees, or agents will be liable for User Submissions or any loss
            or damage resulting from User Submissions.

            Except as provided in the Privacy Policy, we do not guarantee that
            User Submissions will be private, even if the User Submission is in
            a password-protected area. Accordingly, you should not provide User
            Submissions that you want protected from others.

            You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to

            ARBITRATION, CONSENT TO JURISDICTION IN CALIFORNIA, ATTORNEY&quot;S
            FEES
          </TermsSubHeading>
          <TermsText>
            Any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or
            relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof, or any use of the
            Website (including all commercial transactions conducted through the
            Website) (“Claims”), except for claims filed in a small claims court
            that proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis,
            shall be settled by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator
            appointed by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in
            accordance with its then governing rules and procedures, including
            the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, where
            applicable. In agreeing to arbitrate all Claims, you and Hornex.gg
            waive all rights to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding
            involving any Claim. The arbitration shall be held in California,
            and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
            by any court having jurisdiction thereof. This arbitration
            undertaking is made pursuant to and in connection with a transaction
            involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and
            construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration
            Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. This arbitration provision shall
            survive termination of this Agreement. Subject to the limitations
            set forth below, the arbitrator shall have authority to award legal
            and equitable relief available in the courts of California, provided
            that:
          </TermsText>
          <TermsText>
            The arbitrator shall not have authority to award punitive damages;
            and
          </TermsText>
          <TermsText>
            Any and all claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis only
            and shall not be consolidated or joined with or in any arbitration
            or other proceeding involving a Claim of any other party. You and
            Hornex.gg agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to
            arbitrate any Claim as a class action or in any other form other
            than on an individual basis.
          </TermsText>
          <TermsText>
            For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration: (a) the
            exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims
            shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within
            California (the “Forum”), and the parties hereby waive any argument
            that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the
            Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and Hornex.gg waive
            any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.
          </TermsText>
          <TermsText>
            In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any
            Claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section, or
            initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under this Section other
            than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys&quot;
            fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this Agreement to
            arbitrate and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.

              Feedback or ratings cannot be edited or removed once they have

              Users can be held legally responsible for damages to another
              User&quot;s reputation if a court were to find that the feedback
              or ratings constitute libel or defamation. Under federal law (the
              Communications Decency Act) because we do not censor feedback or

              responsible for the feedback or ratings that are posted on the
              Site, even if the feedback or ratings are defamatory. However,

              We will automatically remove feedback from Users indefinitely

            Negative feedback or ratings intended for another User will be
            considered for removal only in situations where the User responsible
            for the mistaken posting informs Hornex.gg of the error and has
            already placed the same feedback for the correct User.
